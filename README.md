# IPL data analysis
Historical Data Analysis Of The Indian Premier League

# This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (ipl.ipynb) dedicated to analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) match data. The project aims to provide insights into various aspects of IPL matches through data manipulation, exploration, and visualization using Python's pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries within a Google Colab environment.
